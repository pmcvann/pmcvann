- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Poppy! 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in astronomy and video games. I also love animals and the environment! In the future I'd love to work in the fields of software engineering and development.
- ðŸŒ± I've graduated my MSci Astrophysics degree and will soon be starting my Planetary Science PhD. I'm self teaching python beyond the scope of my degree, and also learning new programming langauges to help me find a career in software engineering such as C++, JavaScript and SQL.
